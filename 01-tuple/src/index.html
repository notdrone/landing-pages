            Remember when Slack <em>stole</em> Screenhero from us?
          </h1>
          <h2 class="subtitle">We do too, and it <em>sucked</em>.</h2>
          <h2 class="subtitle">That's why we're on a mission to replace it.</h2>
          <p>
            When Slack bought Screehero, we were sure someone new would come
            along to make a tool specifically for pair programming.
          </p>
          <p>But <em>four </em> years later, no one has.</p>
          <p>
            That sucks, because the remaining tools like <em>Skype</em> and
            <em>Hangouts</em> don't give both people full keyboard and mouse
            control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever tried to dictate some code for your pair to write? Or
            narrated a set of vim commands? <em>Not fun</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another problem: if you're going to type on a remote machine, the
            connection has to be super low-latency. This is the sort of thing
            that videoconferencing tools just don't care much about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since no one has built anything as close to as good as
            <em>Screenhero</em> was, we're building its spiritual successor.
